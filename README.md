# AngularThreeJs

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.1 and implemented a simple WebGL compositor with [Three.JS](https://threejs.org/). You can argue the state logic/frameworks are a tad overkill however I was asked to 1) composit a color and video in Three.JS and 2) how in Angular 2+ do you LazyLoad a stateful module from two different people so here we are ;)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
